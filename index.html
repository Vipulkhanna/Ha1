    <h2>Round 1</h2>
    <h3>Answers:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Please go through the website (and only the website) and tell us with a couple of sentences,
in your understanding, how Hansel helps a company improve their conversions. PS: We donâ€™t
expect a perfect answer, so give it a shot.</strong></li>
<p>The new age applications/ websites are increasing customer usability and understanding requirements through many different platforms.
  Since the competetion among the different genres of markets/ services are huge, Products involving user management are at their all time high.
This is where Hansel.io comes in, which provides a one stop solution to gather data as well as take action at the same time.
The initial video is pretty helpful in understanding the complete usability involving understanding the user's requirements through many different sources { Callbacks/ analytical tools ( third party or integrated using user actions ) } and then taking action immediately ( including offers/ suggestions/ reference guides/ images/ options ) to avoid user drop off. The config is simple to understand and can be used by different teams to handle different needs.</p>
<li><strong>You had conveyed a particular date to an important customer for when an update
of Hansel with a feature the customer had requested would be available. You are a few days
away from the deadline, and you figure out that the development has not happened, and could
take another month even if prioritized immediately. Write a response convincing the customer to
give us more time.</strong>
</li>
<p>Its important to understand when to provide an update to the customer before actually replying.
Since I would be regularly following with the Engineering team or checking their progress through an Internal Tool like Jira, I would eventually get to know that it will take more time than usual. Without wasting anytime, I would ask him for the best time to contact him to:
<ul>
  <li>Make him understand the latest progress made regarding the feature.</li>
  <li>Since the deadline is a bit far as of now, Explain him the challenges involved and the steps taken to mitigate them.</li>
  <li>If the feature is actually very helpful for the customer, they will understand the same and with that conversation provide them the new timeline.</li>
  <li>In case step 3 irritates the customer a bit, Provide him a workaround if we can, If not Involve the Customer success manager/ Account manager or Product Manager on what can be done to assist the customer for the time being and suggest the same.</li>
  <li>Every company has some features/ pricing/ or ease of integration because of which the customer is with you. Stick to the good things and make sure the feature is expedited</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<li><strong>An urgent technical query has come up from an important customer and you are
not able to reach anyone else in the team. Please come up with an email response asking for
more time.</strong></li>
<p>Hello Customer,
Greetings.
Thank you for contacting Hansel support.
With reference to the query raised, We understand that its related to an integration limitation with one of your analytical tools with our SDK, Please suggest us the best time to contact you and a callback number.
Meanwhile  I am checking the issue with our Product team and would need more information to discuss the same.</p>
